OCTOPUS
An extremely dangerous threat not to be trifled with

Many people consider the octopus their freind, however they are gravely mistaken.
The octopus is extremely dangerous and will kill when cornered, whether on land or water.
Due to the fact that they are prized as weapons, the octopus has become increasingly rare,
and is only seen in Ironlands ruled by Thorgs who treat Octopus as their freinds. 
A warning: If you see an octopus in the wild, DO NOT APPROACH.
