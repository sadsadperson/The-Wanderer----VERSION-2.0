THE GATE OF TRAVEL
A complete guide to the lengendary gate of travel

According to legend the gate of travel is a mistic location guarded by "the keeper". Whether or not this 'gate' exists is strongly contested, but there is much material that suggests it could of existed but has mostly likely been destroyed in one of the wars that ravaged the land. 
The Gate, was said to be a location where one could unlock the power to travel to the mistic lands. These mistic lands were said to be the birthing place of all monsters. 
The location of the gate is extremely contested, but most agree that it was in the area now controlled by monsters.
The strongest peice of evidence for the existance of the Gate of Travel is that it is mentioned in the journal of King Hignege, some one to two thousand years ago. Translated the passage reads so:
"And so I traveled, I and my army to the Sheng Katav (Traveling Place). There we found a keeper of the gate, he was an old man, and was easily defeated. Knowing that the gate could not be left unguarded, I left three of my best knights to guard it."
The journal then goes on to explain how King Hignege then traveled to the monster kingdom where he attempted to defeat the king of monsters, he failed to do so however.
