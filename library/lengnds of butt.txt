as butt grew older he was mocked for his two eyes and his big butt, but that soon ended becuase by the time he was eight he beat and killed a duck swarm, when the bullys who mocked him learnt of his great feet the decided to leave him alone.

as butt got older and older he grew stronger and stronger, butt was a strong fighter and was feared across the lands, by the time he was fifteen he had seeked and destroyed all the monsters in reialant, butt fealt happy when no monster roamed, but he soon missed fighting, one day he decided to travel. he took all his treasures(thousands of gold coins) and went off. and butt was never seen again. people say that he was killed by a thorg, others say that he killed king thorg and lives in his palace, with all of his treasures, but the truth of butts disappearnce was never descoverd.
