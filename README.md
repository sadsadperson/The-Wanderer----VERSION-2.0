## MONSTERS AND NATIONS
### NATIONS
**Monsterland**: A dark island covered in thick fog. A ravaged land filled with constant burning. Dangerous monsters roam, vaguely controlled by a caste system depending on strenth, the stronging being the Thorgs, which rule monsterland
**Krieten**: The land which men rule, a strong and proud nation, but filled with curuption from the inside. 
**The Wastes**: Lands that were once planned to be inhabited, but are now simply a waste of dry hash stony desert. The few brave Kreitlanders that still dare to try and eck out an existance on this bare rock are constantly raided by Yeckity Toe warriors. These are also the lands were wanderers come from. Tall thin poeple and deadly warriors, they travel the lands, seldom speaking except to ask for word and purchase food.
**Ironclan**: Iron Clan lands, ruled by harsh Thorg war lords who split away from monsterlands becuase they refused to have a peace treaty with other monsters.
**Unknown Lands**Unkown lands, nobody knows that they hold, or what goes on in them. They are just an unkown land.
### MONSTERS
**Orcs**: Just your average orc, ugly, stupid, and easy to defeat, they aren't really much of a threat due to their slow and idiotic nature
**Goblins**: Too small and weak to be much of a trouble, they're bow attacks are annoying but can be dealt with, they do not pose much of a threat
**Kraveb**: Now theses are beasts to be feared, they are tall lizard like monsters that roam waste lands and form up the main population of monsterlands. They are deadly fighters, and will use claws, teeth, spiny tails, and poisonous feathers that come out of their ears to kill any human they come in contact with. They are stupid, but are at least smart enough to survive, and what they lack in brains they make up for in agility, speed, and brute strength
**Icemen**: Also sometimes known as snow landers, these are strange men who live in the unkown lands. Their weapons and armor are forged from ice, and are of little use when brought into the warmer countries where they simply melt. They once tried to take over Kreiten, but simply couldn't becuase their weapons and armor turned into water during the march into battle, the result was a devestating defeat for the icemen, who vanished into the unkown lands are are seldom seen
**Thorgs**: Thorgs are a real monster. Standing at 20 plus feet tall and built from pure muscle, with four arms and a hairy face, they are the most dangerous thing you can fight in all the lands. If you come across a Thorg, the experts say to drop their stuff and run, so far the record states that only three Thorgs were every defeated by a human. One of which was killed when it was sick, unarmed, unable to move. The second was defeated by an archer, who, according to the report. Repeatedly show the thorg in the butt with arrows until it died. Although it was claimed to be a 'juvinile' Thorg, some witnesses say it would be more accurate to call it a 'child'. The only real acount of a Thorg being defeated was in the battle of Grajuer, when King Yetin The 48th defeated a Thorg by, according to his journal; "Removing it's legs with a battle axe, then proceeding to clobber it to death with a three houndred pound war hammer". 
**Rats**: Deadly rodents that infest the streets after dark, most are simply, rats. While other seem to be a little smarter... possibly too much smarter...
**Ducks**: Ducks are kept as farm animals or house hold pets, and are usually not considered a threat. That is, unless they are in a swarm. When ducks swarm, they group together in a large gaggle known as a 'swarm'. During this swarm phase they devour anything in their path, often humans and farm animals. They complete this by sheer numbers. A duck swarm is extremely dangerous. It is nearly impossible to survive one. 
**Grim Quacker**: While it is still questionable as to whether they actually exist. A grim quacker, according to legends is a duck that is hatched in the direct center of a duck swarm. It grows to several hundred pounds, larger then a human, and it's bill forms razor sharp death mandables. If they do exist, grim quackers are extremely dangerous, and should be avoided.
